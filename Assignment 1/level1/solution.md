# What is Cairo designed For, and what makes it unique?

cairo is a language for creating stark provable programs for general computaion. cairo powers starknet and starkEx. cairo is unique because they are provable programs. Provable programs are those programs that can be proven through a mathematical arguements.

# How does Cairo's Virtual CPU handle cryptographic constraints and what advantage does this offer

cairo makes use of Kakarot ZKEVM. Kakarot is meant for developer to build and deploy as if they are working on ethereum virtual machine.


## Advantage
* Specially designed as a provable language for smart contracts
* Unbounded by the limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
* Utilizes traits for a more loosely-coupled relationship compared to inheritance
* Enhanced scalability
* Low transaction cost
* Enhanced privacy and security
* Interoperability with Ethereum
* Compartibility with the Ethereum Ecosystem
