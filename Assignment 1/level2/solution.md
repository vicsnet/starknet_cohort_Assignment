### What is Starknet and what technologies does it leverage for scalability, privacy and security 

Starknet is a permissionless network that leverages the power of zk-STARKs technology for scalability, privacy, and security. As a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, Starknet offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. It functions as a Validity Rollup (commonly known as a zero-knowledge Rollup) that uses cryptographic systems called STARKs to reduce computation costs

### How does starknet function as layer2 scalability solution for ethereum and what cryptographic systems does it use to reduce computation cost

It serves as a layer 2 solution, allowing decentralized applications (DApps) to achieve unlimited scalability for their computations while maintaining the composability and security of the Ethereum ecosystem. StarkNet leverages the power of STARK (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) technology, one of the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof systems available.

By using STARK, StarkNet validates transactions and computations without requiring all network nodes to verify each operation. This significantly reduces the computational burden and increases the throughput of the blockchain network.
