### What is starkware and what hes been its key innovations in the blockchain industry

StarkWare is a leading technology company at the forefront of blockchain scalability and privacy solutions. It focuses on leveraging sophisticated cryptographic protocols, particularly zero-knowledge proofs, or ZK-STARKs, to supercharge blockchain performance. It aims to streamline on-chain computations and improve data availability, providing the foundations for a future where blockchains can handle more transactions with greater efficiency.

StarkWare sets out to resolve the prevalent issues of scalability and privacy in the blockchain sector. Current blockchain technology, while revolutionary, faces limitations in transaction processing speed and capacity. StarkWare’s technology addresses this, reducing on-chain data load and processing, enabling blockchains to handle a greater number of transactions swiftly, securely, and preserving user privacy.

### How does starkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure validity of large batches of transactions off-chain with a minimal on-chain foot print

A STARK proof is a type of zero-knowledge proof that provides guaranteed computational integrity. It allows for the fast verification of a large volume of computation in a succinct way. This technology benefits blockchain transactions by enabling scalable, trustless transactions. It also offers enhanced privacy, making the verification process more efficient and secure.

STARKs (Scalable, Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) are a proof system that enables the proving and verification of computations. It allows processing a big computation, generating a proof for the computation’s correctness, and then verifying the proof in very few steps.

STARKs can play a key role in blockchain scalability by allowing large computations to be done off-chain, where it is cheaper, leaving only the verification, which requires a fraction of the computation, to be done on-chain. In other words, by performing very few steps on-chain, the verifier asserts the integrity of a much larger computation that was done off-chain.

Using STARKs, layer 2 solutions batch together and compute thousands of transactions, and then verify their validity on-chain with a single STARK proof. The cost of the on-chain process is split between all transactions in the batch. This results in Ethereum security and low gas cost per transaction.

The low computational cost will usher in a new class of applications that were previously not feasible on-chain. These properties make STARKs an excellent building block for improving user experience and reducing gas costs, all while maintaining the security of the Ethereum settlement layer.
